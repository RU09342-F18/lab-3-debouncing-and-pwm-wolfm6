For the G2 first the LED (P1.6) and button (P1.3) were configured. The frequeuncy was then set to 1kHz, followed the Timer A0 being set with a smclock, up mode, clear timer to 0, and enabled  a timer interrupt. Timer A1 ws set to CCR1 which enabled the interrupt. Along with an overflow for every 10ms to account for the debounce. I then set a PWM loop which sets the duty cycle. Lastly two switch statements with 2 cases each were set up. State 0 was for when the LED was off -> going to on and on -> going off. State 1 was then contained the case whrere LED was on it would stay on which would then control the brightness of the LED wehn pressed upon the button changing in increments of 10%. Lastly the second case was just in case the LED stayed off.

For the 5529 the only difference was the LED (P1.0) and button (P1.1) were configured differenrly and followed the same steps as talked about in the previous paragraph.
