This code functions as way to identify the mechanical aspect of a button that causes bouncing when it is pressed. For the G2 board the P1.0 was the set output of the LED and P1.3 will be the button that is used. An interrupt is used on the button to keep the LED at current state wehn pressed interrupting the toggle. The capture control register interrupt is enabled and then the frequency is set. Then the timer A control is then set up with the clock and mode. We then set two routines using the vectors. Routine 1 starts the toggle when the button is pressed and activates the timer to act as a delay. Routine 2 then stop the timer and resets the interrupt.

For the 5529 board the only difference is LED output is to P4.7 and the button is set to P1.1. Since both boards are basically same except for the which each ports does. The code matches the G2. An interrupt is used on the button to keep the LED at current state wehn pressed interrupting the toggle. The capture control register interrupt is enabled and then the frequency is set. Then the timer A control is then set up with the clock and mode. We then set two routines using the vectors.
