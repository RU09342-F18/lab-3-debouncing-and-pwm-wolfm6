The same behavior was implemented as used in the software PWM for the G2 board. The only exception was instead of using case statements in the hardware we used timer modules to control the brightness of the LED. Once again the LED was set as an output (P1.6). The button (P1.6) was then set up with a pull up with an interrupt. Now this is where the hardware differs from the software because we will use timer modules to control the rate in which the brightness the LED increases unlike the switch cases we used in software. Inside TimerA1, I used a and if else statement to set the increment level of brightness each time the button is pressed. Intially the LED will start at 50% for that is what I started the CCR1 at. Once the LED has reached 100%, it resets and stops the timer.

The 2311 works in similar way, the only difference is the LED output P2.0 and the button is P1.1. Also the timer modules vary, for example for the G2 to call the to the capture compare control register is declared by TA0CCTL while 5229 is declared by TB0CCTL. Lastly setting the smclk and up mode differ by declarations once again.
